They last for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Emotional Fervor</strong> You can choose not to attempt a flat check to end persistent damage you're taking. When you cast a damaging spell, you can choose one creature that failed its save or that you hit with your spell attack roll. That target takes persistent damage of the same type the spell dealt, of an amount equal to the highest amount of persistent damage you currently have. You can't choose a creature that's already taking persistent damage. Spell: <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.R8bqnYiThB6MYTxD]{Phantom Pain}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Emotional Fallout</strong> You take an untyped penalty to any damage you would deal with any spell you cast until you Settle your Emotions. The penalty is –1 per spell level.</p>\n<p><strong>Focus Spell</strong> <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.xn0V2HDrmDWNzPEt]{Savor the Sting}</em></p>"
